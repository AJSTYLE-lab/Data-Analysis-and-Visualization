# Air Quality Monitoring and Prediction of Pakistani Cities

**Problem Statement:**

Air pollution is a critical environmental issue that poses significant risks to public
health and the overall well-being of communities. Major cities in Pakistan are grappling
with increasing levels of air pollution, adversely affecting the quality of life and posing
health hazards to residents‚Äù. In response to this pressing concern, our project aims to
create an integrated system for monitoring, analyzing, and predicting air quality in
these urban areas.

**Project Description:** 

We are developing a comprehensive system for monitoring and predicting air quality in
major cities across Pakistan. The project involves collecting historical air quality data,
analyzing the impact of various factors (e.g., weather conditions), and building a
predictive model for future air quality. Additionally, visualize the data to provide
insights and warnings to the public.

**Data Source:**

1: [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)

2: [Visual Crossing Weather Data](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api)

Here are screenshot of **170+** Data (including xlsx and tif format):

## Tech Stack

**Programming Languages:** Python, Javascript

**IDE:** Jupyter Lab and Google Collab

**Python Libraries:** selenium,rasterio,requests, Beautifulsoup, plotly, dash, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorfow, seaborn and Google Earth Engine Python API

**Javascript Libraries:** Google Earth Engine JavaScript API 

## Working Process
We divided our tasks into three categories:
### Task #1: Data Collection and Pre-processing

- **Data Collection**: Gathering air quality data from various sources such as Google Earth Engine and Visual Crossing Weather Data.
- **Pre-processing**: Cleaning, filtering, and preparing the data for analysis.

### Task #2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualizing and analyzing spatial patterns in air quality data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying trends, correlations, and other statistical insights from the data.

### Task #3: Model Development

- **Model Training**: 
We conducted model training to forecast air quality levels, employing machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest. Among these, Random Forest exhibited superior performance on the CSV dataset. Additionally, we utilized two deep learning models: CNN for satellite imagery analysis and LSTM for temporal prediction of air quality levels. 

- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance and accuracy of the models. In our analysis, we developed and evaluated two machine learning models and two deep learning models **(CNN and LSTM)** for air quality prediction. Among these, the **LSTM** model demonstrated superior performance, indicating its efficacy in capturing temporal dependencies in the air quality data.
